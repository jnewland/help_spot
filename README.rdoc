= Usage

== Installation

Copy the <tt>config/help_spot.yml.sample</tt> file to <tt>THE_ROOT_DIR_OF_YOUR_APP/config/help_spot.yml</tt>. Edit the file to have some sensible values.

Somewhere in your application, you'll want to do this once:

<tt>HelpSpot.configure</tt>

In my app, it also turns out it's useful to do this once:

<tt>HELPSPOT_CATEGORIES = HelpSpot.category_key_value_pairs</tt>
